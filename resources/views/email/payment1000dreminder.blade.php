Thanks for purchasing from us online.

As this is your first purchase from us online by credit card, we will need to do a payment check before we process it. All we need from you is a screenshot of that specific transaction from your online banking, no personal details are required. If you canâ€™t find the transaction on your online banking, you can call your bank to ask for an authorization code which is unique and email it to us. We will process your order after we have a check with it.

Once we receive it from you, we will arrange shipping immediately. Thanks again and looking forward to your reply soon.
